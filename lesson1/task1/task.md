### Cancellation

We have a simple function, that is being run repeatedly.
It's important that when our coroutine gets cancelled that our function, or loop, also gets cancelled.

Make this function cancellable by inserting a cancellation boundary.

Try to use different cancellation checks, and see if all of them work!
