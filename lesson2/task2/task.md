### lazily launching

When _launching_ different coroutines, it's important that we get some intuition on when which tasks are running.

## Task 1

We need to make sure that the created coroutine starts lazily

## Task 2

Make sure that our lazily created coroutine, is started

Try changing the code, around and see how it affects the order of occurrences
